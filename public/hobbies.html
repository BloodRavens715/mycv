<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>I am an electrical engineer with a passion for technology, constantly exploring the intersection of electrical systems and software. From designing circuits to troubleshooting complex systems, I enjoy finding practical solutions to challenging problems. My engineering background has not only strengthened my analytical skills but also fueled my curiosity to delve into other areas of tech, especially coding.</p>

<p>Coding has become one of my favorite hobbies, allowing me to bring my engineering ideas to life and solve problems creatively. Whether itâ€™s scripting for automation, building small applications, or exploring new programming languages, coding keeps me engaged and continuously learning. It has also expanded my perspective on how software can integrate with hardware, enriching my work as an engineer.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love diving into the virtual world of computer games, where I can unwind and recharge. I also enjoy watching TV shows, especially those with strong storytelling or intriguing technical themes. Gaming and shows offer me a balance between work and relaxation, letting me step away from the technical world and into new adventures and narratives.</p>
